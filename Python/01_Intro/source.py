# Identifiers
#   --> Identifiers are the name used to identify a variable, function,
#        class or an object
#    --> Rules defined for naming an Identifiers:
#            - No special character except underscore can be used as an identifier
#            - Keyword should not be used as an idetifier name
#            - Python is case insensitive, i.e Var and var are two different identifier
#            - First character of an identifier can be character, underscore but not digit
