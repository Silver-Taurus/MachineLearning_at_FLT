# Comprehensions

# Comprehensions are a feature of Python which I woul reallly miss if I ever have to leave it. Comprehensions are constructs that allow sequences to be built
# from other sequences. Following are the types available:
#   --> list comprehension
#   --> dictionary comprehension
#   --> set comprehension
#   --> generator comprehension


# List comprehensions
#   - it provides a short and concise way to create lists. It consists of square brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, the nzero or more for or if 
#   clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.
