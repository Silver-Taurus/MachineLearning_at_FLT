'''
it is not necessary to write *args or **kwargs. Only the * (asterisk) is necessary. 
You could have also written *var and **vars. Writing *args and **kwargs is just a convention. 
So now lets take a look at *args first.
'''


# ---- Usage of *args -----
# *args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function. Hereâ€™s an example to 
# help you get a clear idea:
def test_var_args(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print("Arg through *argv: ", arg)

test_var_args("python","eggs","test")


# ----- Usage of **kwargs -----
# **kwargs allows you to pass keyworded variable length of arguments to a function. You should use **kwargs 
# if you want to handle named arguments in a function. Here is an example to get you going with it:
def test_var_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print("{} = {}".format(key,value))
    
test_var_kwargs(name = "Silver")


# Using *args and **kwargs to call a function
def test_args_kwargs(arg1,arg2,arg3):
    print("arg1: ",arg1)
    print("arg2: ",arg2)
    print("arg3: ",arg3)

args = ("two",3,5)
test_args_kwargs(*args)
kwargs = {"arg3":5,"arg1":2,"arg2":3}
test_args_kwargs(**kwargs)


# Order of using *args **kwargs and formal args

# So if you want to use all three of these in functions then the order is
#   --> some_func(fargs, *args, **kwargs)
